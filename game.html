        <h1>Normal Ending</h1>
        Once a star, now cloaked in the shadows of trauma, all you desire is to be an ordinary person. People still recognize your name, but the isolation lingers. Loneliness pervades, as it seems that no one truly comprehends the depth of your struggle. Despite your pursuit of normalcy, the echoes of fame cast a bittersweet hue over your existence. You find yourself yearning for understanding that remains elusive. In the end, you attain a normal ending, a quiet resolution in the pursuit of a semblance of a regular life.

    <div class="final" id ="bad">
        <h1>Dark Ending</h1>
        You trade your soul, and suddenly they strip away your individuality, trapping your essence forever while replacing you with a clone. No one notices you're gone, and the clone isn't even human.

        <h1>
            Congratulation!!!! You are the winner</h1>
            You just struck gold! <br>
        Even with all the ups and downs, you rocked it as a superstar. Bagged loads of talent, but those mental battle scars linger, keeping you in a bit of a rollercoaster state. But hey, that's what makes you this one-of-a-kind artist.
