        <h1>Normal Ending</h1>
        Once a star, now cloaked in the shadows of trauma, all you desire is to be an ordinary person. People still recognize your name, but the isolation lingers. Loneliness pervades, as it seems that no one truly comprehends the depth of your struggle. Despite your pursuit of normalcy, the echoes of fame cast a bittersweet hue over your existence. You find yourself yearning for understanding that remains elusive. In the end, you attain a normal ending, a quiet resolution in the pursuit of a semblance of a regular life.

    <div class="final"  id ="broken">
        <h1>Bad Ending</h1>
        Despite the internal and external fractures, you persevered as a superstar. Although you achieved a positive outcome in becoming an immensely talented star, the mental scars persist, leaving you forever trapped in a tumultuous state of mind.

    <div class="final"  id ="good">
        <h1>Iconic Ending</h1>
       You stay forever an icon because of your social impact and unique story.
